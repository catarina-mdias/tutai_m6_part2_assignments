# Building & Deploying AI Agents Applications - Assignments

This repository includes the development of the class assignments for Tutai's Module 6 - Building and Deploying AI Agents.

> *These assignment deliverables were developed by Catarina Dias.*

## Assignments
- `assignments/class-05-deployment-lab/` — ship a Tavily-powered agent with FastAPI, Streamlit, and Langfuse tracing.

- `assignments/class-06-guardrails-lab/` — layer safety checks onto the Class 5 agent and document your guardrail strategy.

Each assignment folder includes its own ASSIGNMENT_INSTRUCTIONS with deliverables and prerequisites defined by the instructor; and a README file with the performed changes during the assignment development and prompt examples.
